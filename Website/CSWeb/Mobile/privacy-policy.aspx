        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is effective as of January 14, 2017, for a website owned by Junee Brands, LLC ("Company"). The Company's network includes numerous product marketing Web sites (the "Websites"). The Privacy Policy is in effect for all Websites owned and operated by the Company. By using any of the Websites, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all online communication with Websites owned by the Company. When you provide us with online information through any of the Websites, we respect your privacy. It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information. Please note that your visit to any of our Websites is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
        <h3>Information Collection</h3>
        <p>We only collect personally identifiable information about you via our Websites when you voluntarily provide it in connection with a purchase of a product, service, or request information. For example, if you decide to place an order, we will ask you for your name, delivery and billing address, phone number(s), email address, credit card number and its expiration date. If you choose to complete a user registration form, survey or sweepstakes entry form, we may ask you for information such as your contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address and mailing address), age group or birth date. Occasionally, we may also ask you for other information such as gender, income level, and information about your prior experiences with the Company's products. When you submit your personally identifiable information on one of the Websites, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may also collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular, your IP address, browser type, city, time zone, referring URL, and operating system. Static IP addresses are considered personal information.  For mobile users accessing the Website, we automatically collect your Unique Device Identifier which is also considered personal information. However, the user cannot be recognized as a specific individual simply from a Static IP address or a UDI.  Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics, developing marketing plans, customizing content, and improving the Website.  In addition, aggregate and personally identifiable information may be shared with and analyzed by authorized third party vendors who may not use the information for any other purpose. We may also share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees and partners. </p>
        <p>All of our Websites are intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. However, if the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com">unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com</a> if they want this information deleted from our files so that it is not in retrievable form. If we otherwise obtain knowledge that we have personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will delete that information from our existing files so that it is not retrievable." </p>
        <h3>Use/Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries may use the information that you provide to fulfill your order for a product, request information or other service, or respond to an email or other request, as well as to create and deliver to you our newsletters or surveys, communications containing product information, usage tips or promotions, help improve our website(s) or services, or customize visitors' experience at our Website(s). However, if you do not want us to share this information, we will be unable to fulfill your order or provide additional services. In such case, please use our unsubscribe page and we will not share such information. The Company may also make your name, email address, mailing address and/or telephone number available to carefully selected business partners, vendors and other third party organizations to provide you with information about products, services and special offers we think may interest you or to improve our products, services and advertising. Many of our users find this a valuable and time-saving service. You can change or update your personally identifiable information on the website by changing your account information.  
We want to communicate with you via email correspondence only if you want to hear from us. If for any reason you would no longer like to receive email messages from the Company, you can email <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com">unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com</a>. In addition, if you do not want us to share your personal information with third party organizations, you can email us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com">unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com</a> to remove yourself. Please allow up to 10 days for us to process your request.</p>
        <p>Please note, if you opt not to receive marketing emails from the Company, you may still receive "Transactional" email messages regarding your order (i.e. order confirmation, shipping information, customer service notifications, etc.) If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com">unsubscribe@JuneeBrands.com</a>. We may contract with third party companies or individuals to provide certain services including email and hosting services, credit card processing, shipping, data management, surveys and marketing, promotional services, to assist in preventing or deterring fraud, etc. We call them our Service Providers. We may share personally identifiable information with Service Providers solely as appropriate for them to perform their functions, but they may not use such information for any other purpose.
We do not share your credit card information with unaffiliated third parties unless you authorize us to do so, or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities including, but not limited to, delivering a product or service that you order. </p>
        <p>Finally, the Company may in its sole discretion disclose personal information in special cases: (1) when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights of the Company or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; (2) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (3) to any third party who may acquire the Company; and (4) in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
        <h3>Ensuring Your Security</h3>
        <p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security protocol that protects your credit card information and ensures secure online ordering. SSL Internet connections are encrypted, and thus protect all credit card ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so it cannot be read in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal information. Please note, however, that although we employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard the security of your personal information, no transmissions made on or through the Internet are guaranteed to be secure.</p>
        <h3>Safe Shopping Policy</h3>
        <p>Our policy is that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping on one of our Websites. It is determined that under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.</p>
        <h3>Technology Utilized</h3>
        <p>Like many e-commerce websites, we employ several commonly used technologies on this Website: cookies, clear gifs, networking traffic monitoring and active scripting. We use these to monitor the performance of the Website, measure its effectiveness, tailor our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others, estimate our audience size, assist our online merchants to track visits to and sales at our Websites and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns. </p>
        <p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. If you disable cookies, you may be unable to order or use other features of our Website.
"Clear gifs" (also known as "web beacons" or “pixel tag”) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to help us better optimize our advertising.</p>
        <p>"Network traffic monitoring" is programming that monitors and analyzes network traffic, and can be used to capture data being transmitted on a network, including plain-text data and computer IP addresses. "Active scripting" is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as which links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or mobile device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
        <p>We may combine automatically collected Website usage information with your Personal Information. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>
        <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
        <p>Some web browsers offer a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal. A DNT signal is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. Although we are currently unable to honor DNT signals, we do not collect personal information when you visit our Websites unless you provide such information to us. We also work with third parties that use tracking technologies on our Websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and/or on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our sites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third party websites and applications. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, you can visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info</a></p>
        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>Information about our users and the Website is one of our most important business assets. Therefore, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Website or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the Company. </p>
        <h3>External Links</h3>
        <p>Our Websites may offer links to and from other third party sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. For example, you may have linked to the Junee Brands LLC brand site through a banner advertisement on another site. In such cases the site you have linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.</p>
        <h3>International Users</h3>
        <p>Like almost every website, our Websites may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our Websites and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction and in jurisdictions which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.</p>
        <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Company who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding twelve calendar months. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to <br />
